Before everything else: I find it quite embarrassing that such an email
arrives at me as a private email with only one CC. Can I publish your
email and my answer? I'm not feeling well when testing becomes a topic
that is based on deals behind closed doors.

Yes thanks. I haven't heard for a long time from you. Are you still at
Booking in Amsterdam?

Sure I "can help you out". Where is the mailing list that discusses the
proposals how to proceed, that supervises the testing, that collects and
interpretes the results, that draws conclusions form the results and
defines whether they are sufficient, reliable, trustworthy, good enough?
In other words: is there a well-defined testing plan? And if not who
develops it?

Without that my willingness to "help out" is not worth much, because it
will in no way be sufficient. My resources are way too limited, both in
terms of equipment and in the efforts I can put into it. And the testing
by vendors is even less sufficient. "Supplementing the testing of
vendors" does not sound like a commendable plan to me. It should be the
other way round.

In other words, who is in charge and who is the controlling community?
