Subject: Help smoke security releases?
To: Andreas Koenig
Cc: Steve Hay

Hi Andreas,

I hope this email finds you well.

In the past, we made a mistake of not reaching out to you to privately
smoke releases. We have a pending security release we could use your help
to smoke.

Based on feedback from vendors, we decided we will try a different path
with security maintenance releases. Instead of making the release and
pushing the commits on the day of the RC (an in the process, blow the cover
on the security-related changes before disclosure date), we will be
privately sending the RC tarball to all vendors. (Some explicitly offered
to help us test.) Once the RCs will pass, we will move forward with the
stable. (This is only for maintenance releases, not new versions.)

We would like to supplement the testing of vendors with your smoking
services. Could you help us out?

Thanks,
S.
