You can definitely publish my request and your answer. Hell, put it on a
blog post, for all I care. :)

The only thing you cannot share is the tarball that you are testing. The
whole idea is to try something different because vendors requeted that we
stop publishing RC tarballs of security releases, because it defies the
entire idea. We are asking them to wait until the disclosure date with the
fixes and at the same time, we publish our own fixes. They called out and
said "This isn't fair." So we're trying to do it differently this time and
see if it works.

The fact that we are doing a security release is not a secret. The fact we
request your help to test it is also not a secret. And if you are willing
or unwilling is also not a secret in any way. :)

Yeah. I'm dealing with stuff. :)

I moved from Amsterdam to Tel Aviv, Israel. I still work for Booking.com.

I'm not sure what you mean here, and I could be missing something big, so
feel free to fix my understanding and view.

Normally, for all versions, we release RCs prior. This includes stable
versions, this includes maintenance versions, and this includes security
releases for maintenance versions. These RCs receive public smoking, much
of it yours.

We would like to do the same with the release that Steve is prepping but
doing it publicly means the security fixes (which we already reviewed the
security team) will be made public. We are asking for your help to smoke
the releases. The results *can* be public. They don't contain the public
commit history or the patches, so there's no secret about the tests (unless
you uncover a security issue). We would then make sure that Steve, Tony,
Dave, Yves, Hugo, Craig, and others in the security team will review those
results so we could act on them if they are a problem, and then produce RC2.

Does that make sense?

This is definitely not as widely tested as other releases. We know this is
a problem, but the alternative was publishing the security fixes publicly
before the disclosure date. What this effectively meant is that we are
breaking our own embargo. Vendors were understandably upset about this and
asked us to stop.

The changes are first only merging the security bugs, leaving all other
fixes out of the way. This allows us a smaller diff to worry about when
testing. Secondly, we are inviting other vendors to help us test. We have
had a few positive responses that are now testing out our RC1. We are
hoping you could expand our pool of testing, but that depends on your
capabiilties (time, machines, etc.) and willingness.

We could not figure out a way to publicly test withotu publicly sharing the
sources. If you can, I would like to hear it and work towards it. Any
suggestions are more than welcome!

After we handle the security patches, we will move forward with
non-security related fixes. That will be another maintenance version and
the RCs for that will need to be more thoroughly tested, and they will
happen publicly as before.

I want to stress that only the security maintenance release will get this
treatment.

I don't understand what "Who is the controlling community?" means.
