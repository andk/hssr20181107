Andreas, I really think you're approaching this from the wrong direction.
Your tone seems to suggest a secret society that does something bad in
secret so citizens won't know about it.

This is just Steve and I reaching directly to a smoker who offered to
smoke, and asking him to help with it.

I don't understand what you gain from sharing that Steve and I asked you to
smoke a security release, but... yeah, go ahead.

I'm not sure what you refer to with "change your mind."

Becaue I didn't see a need to send it to all of p5p if this is something I
want to send to you. Just like when I want Yves to take a look at an issue,
I don't publish it to all of p5p. I just email Yves directly. Why is this
so weird for you?

I replied in context, so the paragraph above my questions is what I refered
to.

Here I refered to "Where is the mailing list that discusses the proposals
how to proceed, that supervises the testing, that collects and interpretes
the results, that draws conclusions form the results and defines whether
they are sufficient, reliable, trustworthy, good enough? In other words: is
there a well-defined testing plan? And if not who develops it?"

I thought I provided information on what we're doing here and what the plan
is, so I'm really not sure what you are asking for. There is a security
mailing list, and the security mailing list is aware of this attempt at
changing the security release cycle. The plan is very clear and I've stated
it multiple times: Release the RCs to the vendors (and hopefully a willing
smoker - such as yourself), and when the final release is ready for the
public, push all commits. Then proceed with maintenance releases as usual.

What would "the other way round" look like?

Previous test failures of a security release are discussed on the security
mailing list. This case would be exactly the same. I mentioned the people
on this list. I don't see how this is any different in this regard.

Let's say we do it the opposite way. We push everything when we do an RC.
You run a smoker and send a test failure. We still cannot (and never have,
as far as I recall - at least I'm hoping we haven't) discussed publicly the
fix to a bug in a security release for a security issue that is not
publicly disclosed and is under embargo. Because, if we had, that owuld
have been unprofessioanl and very wrong behavior. Instead, as we want to do
now, every test failure (public or not) is discussed on the security
discussion mailing list. I have listed people who are in the discussion
mailing list.

Because we only wanted *your* help and there was no need to publicly reach
out to you when I can just email you directly. I really, really cannot
fathom why this is weird for you.

Let's say I wanted to ask you whether you are attending a conference,
should I write a public post to reach out to you? Should I wrote on p5p to
do this? Or should I email you directly? I would go with directly.

The feeling I'm getting is that you are uncomfortable with me reaching to
you directly, and prefer this to be done publicly. If that is the case, I
would be happy to write an email to p5p with the following:

Subject: Andreas, could you please help us smoke test a security release?
Body:

Hi Andreas,

We have released an RC for a security release. To avoid pushing fixes for
undisclosed issues (a mistake we have normally done in the past, which
received strong negative feedback from vendors), we decided to publish it
direclty to smokers and to vendors. The release will be limited to only
security fixes which were vetted by the security team.

We would like your help to test this RC. You may publicly post the test
report (as long as it doesn't contain information on the security issue or
its fix) or send it privately to the RT security queue, so the security
team could review and apply necessary fixes. We will limit the scope of
this release to security related issues only, so we could continue with our
normal release cycle regarding other fixes.

Thanks,
Sawyer.

Would that be better? Should I always approach you publicly, even with
matters that I address only to you?

I'm definitely willing to do that, I just see no point. If that's what you
prefer, it's not a problem.
